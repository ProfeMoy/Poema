            Hello? (Hello? Hello? Hello?)

            Is there anybody in there?
            Just nod if you can hear me
            Is there anyone home?
            Come on now
            I hear you're feeling down
            Well I can ease your pain
            Get you on your feet again
            Relax
            I'll need some information first
            Just the basic facts
            Can you show me where it hurts?

            There is no pain you are receding
            A distant ship smoke on the horizon
            You are only coming through in waves
            Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
            When I was a child I had a fever
            My hands felt just like two balloons
            Now I've got that feeling once again
            I can't explain you would not understand
            This is not how I am
            I have become comfortably numb

            I have become comfortably numb
            
            Okay (okay, okay, okay)
            Just a little pinprick
            There'll be no more, ah
            But you may feel a little sick
            Can you stand up?
            I do believe it's working, good
            That'll keep you going through the show
            Come on it's time to go

            There is no pain you are receding
            A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
            You are only coming through in waves
            Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
            When I was a child
            I caught a fleeting glimpse
            Out of the corner of my eye
            I turned to look but it was gone
            I cannot put my finger on it now
            The child is grown
            The dream is gone
